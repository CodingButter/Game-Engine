> ## Introduction And Project Overview

</br>

    Hey Everybody, CodingButter Here Just Spreading Some Knowledge

    I am a self taught web developer who is a terrible teacher. That being said let me teach you some stuff.

    I'm thinking we build a 2D Game Engine from the ground up..
    Why not use Someone else...
    Because No!

    How are we gonna learn to really program if it's done for us!!
    Lets come up with our own code and type words that get stuff done

</br>

> ## Video Goals

</br>

- Gather all the tools needed to get a proper coding environment set up.
- Use these tools to initialize our project.
- Run our project.
- Make Some Edits to the project.

</br>

> ## Installing VS Code

</br>

- It's been widely adopted over the last few years.
- better support
- better docs
- large community
- large repository of useful plugins

</br>

> ## Installing NodeJS And NPM

</br>

<a style="color:white" href="https://nodejs.org/en/download/"><img src="https://nodejs.org/static/images/logo.svg" alt="VS-Code-Download" width="100"></a>

Node comes with npm installed so we can include npm packages in our projects.

- Easy to create, test, and deploy projects
- Server side and client side
- With npm we will have the ability to install Packages from others which we may or may not do in later videos.

</br>

> ## Installing GIT

</br>

<a style="color:white" href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server"><img src="https://git-scm.com/images/logos/downloads/Git-Icon-1788C.png" alt="Git" width="25"> GIT</a>

Git will give us a set of tools to use in the terminal for following along with the tutorial series as well as storing your own copy of the project. We are going to specifically use this so we can view the project at different stages. This way you can follow along or just pick up from the beginning of a video in the series.

</br>

> ## Cloning The Starter

</br>

1. Creating a folder and opening it up in VS Code.
2. Open the terminal and enter the following command

```
git clone -b game-engine-starter https://github.com/CodingButter/new-beginner-javascript-game-engine.git Game-Engine
```

</br>

> ## NPM Install and NPM START

</br>

Now that that is cloned we can install our dependancies. Type the following command

```
npm install
```

</br>

This will install all the necessary dependancies for us to get started

</br>

Now lets run our project!!!!

```
npm run start
```

> ## Video And Project Summary

</br>

    We typed code that does things CONGRATS!

- Why VS CODE
- Why Node/NPM
- Why GIT
- Why use the starter?
- Importance of keeping a clean project structure
